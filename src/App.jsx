    <p><strong>Location and Boundaries</strong> <br />
Marinduque, a charming heart-shaped island about 35 km across, is located 170 km southeast of Manila. This lovely province is home to six municipalities and spans 96,000 hectares. 
A hidden gem within Marinduque is the Marinduque Wildlife Sanctuary (MWS). Encompassing almost 9,758.71 hectares across two parcels of land, MWS is a haven for diverse wildlife. This mountainous sanctuary sprawis across five municipalities and 23 barangays, bordered by the municipalities of Boac, Santa Cruz, Buenavista, Torrijos, and Gasan. 
Parcel 1, part of the Balagbag Mountain Range in the southwest, boasts a peak of 821 meters above sea level. Parcel II, located in Central Marinduque, reaches even higher at 854 meters. These parcels feature steep gorges, swift rivers like the Boac River, and stunning waterfalls</p>
<p><strong>Climate and Weather Patterns </strong><br />
Marinduque's weather is generally pleasant, with no distinct wet or dry season. It gets a bit warmer from March to May. The Island experiences a fair amount of rain throughout the year, particularty from June to December. This helps keep the island lush and green However, like many places, Marinduque is experiencing the effects of climate change. Experts predict that temperatures will gradually rise and rainfall patterns may change. The good news is that we're working with organizations like DOST-PAGASA to better understand and prepare for these changes. We want to make sure Marinduque remains a beautiful and enjoyable place to visit and live for years to coine </p>
<p><strong>• Flora </strong><br />
In 2003, several endangered tree species were found in the Marinduque Wildlife Sanctuary (MWS), including Apitong, Red Lauan, and White Lauan. These trees play a crucial role in maintaining the area's watershed. <br /> 
To keep track of the forest's health, a monitoring program was set up in 2017. This involved counting and identifying trees within a specific area. The survey found a diverse range of tree species, with Mayapis, Lanutan, and Syzygium being the most common. Some rare and endangered species were also discovered, such as Baguilumbang and Narra. <br />
While the monitoring program provided valuable information, there's still more to learn. Several tree species remain unidentified, and further research is needed to fully understand the forest's composition and ensure its protection for the future. <br />
Characterized by secondary growth forest, grassland, and coconut groves. <br />
<strong>Critically Endangered:</strong> Apitong (Dipterocapus grandiflorus), White Lauan (Shorea contorta), Bolong-eta (Diospyros pilosanthera var.pilosanthrea) <br />
<strong>Endangered:</strong> Dalingdingan (Hopea foxworthyl), Mayapis (Shorea palosapis) <br />
<strong>Threatened: </strong>Red Lauan (Shorea negrosensis) <br />
<strong>Vulnerable:</strong> Narra (Pterocarpus indicus), Dao(Dracontomelon dao)</p>
<p>
<strong>Fauna </strong><br />
The Marinduque Wildlife Sanctuary (MWS) is a haven for wildlife, earning its recognition as an Important Bird Area and Key Biodiversity Area. It's home to several unique and threatened species, including the Philippine Duck, Philippine Cockatoo, and the Giant Philippine Frog. The sanctuary is also known as the "Butterfly Capital of the Philippines" due to its impressive butterfly population. Researchers have been actively studying the wildlife in the MWS, focusing on bats and birds. Through careful monitoring, they've identified a diverse range of species, although the numbers appear to be declining. While many of these species are currently classified as "Least Concern, their diminishing numbers highlight the importance of continued conservation efforts in the sanctuary. 
The MWS serves as a critical refuge for these creatures, and ongoing research and monitoring will help ensure their survival for generations to come.

• Ecosystems <br />
The Marinduque Wildlife Sanctuary (MWS) is divided into two main zones: <br />
<strong>Strict Protection Zone:</strong> This is the heart of the MWS, covering most of its area. It's a haven for biodiversity and is generally off-limits to human activities, except for scientific research or traditional practices of indigenous communities. <br />
<strong>Multiple Use Zone: </strong>This zone is smaller and allows for some sustainable human activities like farming, agroforestry, and ecotourism. It's 
designed to support local livelihoods while still protecting the environment. This zone includes areas for community projects, infrastructure, and water sources. <br />
This zoning system helps balance the need for conservation with the needs of the local community. It ensures that the MWS remains a 
thriving ecosystem while still providing benefits to the people who live nearby

<h2>ECOTOURISM OPPORTUNITITES</h2> 
Marinduque's tourism is primarily focused on the Lenten season, with most visitors coming to see friends and family. To create a more sustainable and diverse economy, the island is promoting ecotourism in the Marinduque Wildlife Sanctuary (MWS) 
Ecotourism offers an innovative solution: it allows visitors to experience the island's natural beauty and culture, while also supporting conservation efforts and generating income for the local community. The MWS is well-suited for ecotourism, with its diverse wildlife and stunning landscapes. 
Visitors to the MWS pay entrance and rental fees, which contribute to the Integrated Protected Areas Fund (IPAF). This fund supports the management and protection of the sanctuary, ensuring its long-term sustainability. 
Since 2017, there has been a steady increase in tourist arrivals at the MWS, peaking in April during the dry season. This growth in ecotourism is a promising sign for Marinduque's future, as it diversifies the economy and promotes sustainable development.
